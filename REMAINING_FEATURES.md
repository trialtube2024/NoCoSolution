### Development Approach
For the next agent continuing work on NocoStudio, we recommend:

1. Start with the Authentication System as it's fundamental to secure the application
2. Follow with User Management features
3. Then implement Advanced Data Management and Form Features
4. Continue with the other features based on priority

The codebase is organized with:
- Frontend React components in `client/src/pages/` and `client/src/components/`
- Backend API endpoints in `server/routes.ts`
- Shared types in `shared/schema.ts`

All necessary UI components from shadcn/ui are already set up and can be leveraged for new features.
