### Development Approach
For the next agent continuing work on NocoStudio, we recommend:

1. Complete the Authentication System with token refresh and "remember me" functionality
2. Implement User Preferences features (theme, notifications, language settings)
3. Continue with Advanced Data Management (import/export, advanced filtering)
4. Add Advanced Form Features (conditional logic, file uploads)
5. Implement the remaining features based on priority

The codebase is organized with:
- Frontend React components in `client/src/pages/` and `client/src/components/`
- Backend API endpoints in `server/routes.ts`
- Shared types in `shared/schema.ts`

All necessary UI components from shadcn/ui are already set up and can be leveraged for new features.
