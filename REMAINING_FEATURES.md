## Remaining Features to Implement

1. Password Reset Flow

   - Reset password email
   - Reset password form
   - Email verification

3. Security Enhancements
   - Rate limiting

### Development Approach
For the next steps, we recommend:

1. Complete the Password Reset flow implementation
2. Add User Profile Management features
3. Implement Security Enhancements
4. Add Advanced Form Features (conditional logic, file uploads)

The codebase is organized with:
- Frontend React components in `client/src/pages/` and `client/src/components/`
- Backend API endpoints in `server/routes.ts`
- Shared types in `shared/schema.ts`

All necessary UI components from shadcn/ui are already set up and can be leveraged for new features.
