# NocoStudio Progress Notes

## Current Implementation Status

### Authentication System
- ✅ JWT token-based authentication implemented on server-side
- ✅ Client-side AuthProvider context created to manage authentication state
- ✅ Login and register pages implemented to work with JWT
- ✅ Token storage in localStorage with auto-login functionality
- ✅ Protected routes redirect to login if not authenticated
- ✅ API request utilities updated to include auth tokens in headers
- ✅ Navigation component that shows different options based on auth status

### Core Features
- ✅ Schema Designer module (basic implementation)
- ✅ Form Builder module (basic implementation)
- ✅ Workflow Builder module (basic implementation)
- ✅ Role Manager for access control (basic implementation)
- ✅ Data Explorer module (basic implementation)
- ✅ Dashboard module (basic implementation)
- ✅ Profile management page (basic implementation)

## Next Steps

### Authentication Refinements
1. Implement password reset functionality
2. Add email verification process
3. Enhance security with token refresh mechanism
4. Add "remember me" functionality
5. Implement session timeout handling

### User Experience
1. Add loading states and better error handling in auth flows
2. Implement form validation feedback throughout the application
3. Create a user onboarding process for new users
4. Add user preferences and settings

### Feature Enhancement
1. Enhance Schema Designer with visual relationship mapping
2. Improve Form Builder with more field types and validation options
3. Add advanced workflow triggers and actions in Workflow Builder
4. Enhance Role Manager with fine-grained permissions
5. Improve Data Explorer with filtering, sorting, and export capabilities
6. Create dashboard widgets and customization options

### Technical Improvements
1. Implement proper error boundaries
2. Add unit and integration tests
3. Optimize performance with memoization and code splitting
4. Implement proper database transactions and error handling
5. Add proper logging and monitoring capabilities

## Technical Decisions and Implementation Notes

### Authentication
- Using JWT for stateless authentication with 24-hour expiration
- Token structure includes user ID, username, and role
- Auth context provides user data and login/logout functions throughout the app
- Protected routes check authentication status via the AuthProvider

### API Communication
- All API requests include auth tokens via headers when available
- Using TanStack Query for data fetching with automatic cache invalidation
- API error handling with proper user feedback

### UI Components
- Using Shadcn UI component library with Tailwind CSS for styling
- Responsive design with mobile-first approach
- Form validation using Zod schemas

## Known Issues
1. Navigation component has been implemented but might need refinement for proper mobile support
2. Some TypeScript errors might need attention in the codebase
3. Layout might need adjustments for better responsive behavior
4. Login/Register forms basic validation implemented but could be enhanced

## Test Account Credentials
- Username: admin
- Password: password
- Role: admin
