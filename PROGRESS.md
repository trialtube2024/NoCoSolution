# NocoStudio Progress Report

## Project Overview
NocoStudio is a no-code/low-code platform similar to NocoBase, built with a modern React frontend and Express backend. The platform allows users to build custom applications without writing code, featuring schema design, form building, workflow automation, role-based access control, and data management capabilities.

## Components Implemented

### 1. Home Page
- Created a responsive dashboard with module cards for navigation
- Cards for Schema Designer, Form Builder, Workflow Builder, Access Control, Data Explorer
- Implemented proper routing with wouter

### 2. Schema Designer
- Created a visual interface for defining data models/schemas
- Implemented collection and field management
- Added support for various field types (string, number, boolean, enum, etc.)
- Implemented JSON view for schema visualization

### 3. Form Builder
- Built a drag-and-drop form designer
- Implemented form field configuration with various input types
- Added form preview functionality
- Created form settings management

### 4. Workflow Builder
- Designed a visual workflow editor
- Implemented workflow triggers (collection events, schedule, etc.)
- Added support for various step types (actions, conditions, etc.)
- Created execution history tracking with status indicators

### 5. Access Control
- Implemented role-based permission management
- Created a permission matrix for granular access control
- Added user assignment to roles
- Built user management within roles

### 6. Data Explorer
- Implemented a data browser for all collections
- Added sorting, filtering, and searching capabilities
- Created record creation, editing, and deletion functionality
- Built support for different data types

### 7. Backend APIs
- Implemented RESTful APIs for schemas, collections, forms, workflows
- Added authentication endpoints (login, register)
- Created role and permission management endpoints
- Implemented data CRUD operations

### 8. General UI/UX
- Used shadcn/ui components for a consistent, modern interface
- Added responsive design for mobile, tablet, and desktop
- Implemented proper navigation with breadcrumbs
- Added loading states and error handling

## Current State
The application has a functional frontend with all major modules implemented, and a backend with the necessary API endpoints. The platform allows users to:

1. Design data schemas with collections and fields
2. Build forms for data entry
3. Create workflows for automating processes
4. Manage roles and permissions
5. Explore and manipulate data

## Next Steps
1. **User Authentication Flow**: Implement a complete authentication system with registration, login, password reset, etc.
2. **Dashboard Analytics**: Create a dashboard with usage metrics and analytics
3. **Export/Import**: Add functionality to export and import schemas, forms, workflows, etc.
4. **Advanced Workflow Features**: Implement more complex workflow actions like API calls, delay steps, etc.
5. **Integration with External Services**: Add connectors for services like email, SMS, etc.
6. **Testing**: Implement comprehensive testing for all components
7. **Documentation**: Create user and developer documentation

## Technical Stack
- **Frontend**: React, TailwindCSS, shadcn/ui, wouter, TanStack Query
- **Backend**: Express, Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL
- **State Management**: React Query for server state, React Hooks for local state
- **Form Management**: React Hook Form with Zod validation
- **Routing**: wouter

## Known Issues
- Some TypeScript errors in the data explorer component need to be addressed
- Need to implement proper data fetching from the backend in all components
- Authentication flow needs to be completed
